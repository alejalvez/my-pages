I just finished this great [video on Swift development by Paul Hudson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNXzcAwNqMc).

I learned about Swift and SwiftUI, as well as an overview of what I should do and not do in iOS development:

- I want to start using SwiftUI, using the [SwiftUI Concepts Tutorials](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui-concepts)
- I should try to connect with other people and resources for help in development (do not become a lone wolf!)
- I figured that trying to learn Swift itself was less important than trying to use SwiftUI due to time constraints
- I already downloaded Xcode and began the tutorials

I do not know enough yet and still need to learn about what I can do before I decide on a goal for this summer, but I hope to be able to
make a simple application.

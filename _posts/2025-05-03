I just finished this great video on iOS development by Paul Hudson: [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNXzcAwNqMc).

I learned about Swift and SwiftUI, as well as an overview of what I should do and not do in iOS development:

- I want to start using SwiftUI, using the SwiftUI Concepts Tutorials.
- I should try to connect with other people and resources for help in development.
